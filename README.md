# Unity-Day-Cycle

This project is an experiment that will demo a Day and Night Cycle in Unity. The user would be able to control the day cycle using a provided UI that can be brought up and hidden with a keystroke / menu. This takes inspiration from a day and night cycle UI from the game Genshin Impact.
